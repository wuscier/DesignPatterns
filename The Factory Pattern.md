All factory patterns encapsulate object creation. 

# Simple Factory(NOT A Design PATTERN)
  An object handles the instantiation of the concrete classes
  
  
# Factory Method
  Let subclasses decide what objects to create
  
  
# Abstract Factory
  The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface
for creating families of related or dependent objects
without specifying their concrete classes.
